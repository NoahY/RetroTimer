RetroTimer is a wonderfully simple, no-nonsense countdown timer.
Inspired by an old-fashioned analog egg timer, you just turn the
dial and the alarm is set! To cancel the alarm, just turn it
back down to zero.

The feature set has intentionally been kept very small, so it
won't distract you from what you are trying to get done. Your
only options are to toggle the ringer and vibrator, so you can
use it e.g. in an open office environment.

The application includes code from the DeskClock application
that is included with the Android operating system. Therefore,
some parts of the code are licensed under the Apache Software
License. Both the Apache License and the GNU General Public
License are included, in the files NOTICE-ASL and COPYING-GPL,
respectively.
